    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to ensure authorization independence, clarity, and scalability for the WanderLust application. We leverage a top-level 'trips' collection to simplify queries for public, shared, and owned trips. The core entities (Users, Trips, Entries, Routes, and Comments) are organized in a way that mirrors their relationships while optimizing for security and query performance.\n\n*   **/users/{userId}**: Stores user profiles. Security rules will ensure that only the authenticated user can read and write their own profile.\n*   **/trips/{tripId}**: This top-level collection stores all trip documents. This structure is efficient for querying across all trips (e.g., for the public explore page). Security rules will manage access: a user can read a document if `visibility == 'public'`, if `ownerId == request.auth.uid`, or if their `uid` is in the `sharedWith` array. Write access is restricted to the trip owner.\n*   **/trips/{tripId}/entries/{entryId}**: This continues the ownership pattern, with entries nested under trips. Security rules will be based on the parent trip's ownership and visibility settings, requiring a `get()` call to the parent trip document to check for read access. This is a standard and secure pattern for nested data. Write access to entries is limited to the trip owner or users the trip is shared with.\n*   **/routes/{routeId}**: Stores route data in a top-level collection. Route documents include a `tripId` field. This segregation allows routes to be queried independently if needed while security rules will check the referenced trip's ownership to grant access.\n*   **/comments/{commentId}**: Stores comments on entries in a top-level collection. The comment document includes an `entryId` and `tripId`. This structure simplifies querying comments and allows security rules to check the parent trip's visibility for read access."
